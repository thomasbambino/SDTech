The logs confirm that the due date is being updated successfully on the server:

```
Successfully updated project: {
  project: {
    id: 12796597,
    title: 'Test Project9',
    description: 'Test Pop',
    due_date: '2025-03-26',
    client_id: 1163333,
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

And the request to get the project returns a 304 (Not Modified) status code:

```
GET /api/freshbooks/clients/12796597/projects/12796597 304 in 413ms
```

This 304 response might be the key to our issue. It means the browser is using a cached version of the response. Let's modify your code to address this:

1. First, add a timestamp to your query key to prevent caching:

```jsx
// In your project fetch query
{
  queryKey: ["/api/freshbooks/clients", id, "projects", id, Date.now()],
  queryFn: async () => {
    // Your existing fetch function
  }
}
```

2. Alternatively, you can add cache-busting headers to your fetch request:

```jsx
const response = await fetch(`/api/freshbooks/clients/${id}/projects/${id}`, {
  credentials: 'include',
  headers: {
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'Pragma': 'no-cache'
  }
});
```

3. For a quick test, let's try forcing a page reload after successful update:

```jsx
// In your updateDueDateMutation's onSuccess callback
onSuccess: () => {
  // Your existing invalidate queries code...
  
  toast({
    title: "Success",
    description: "Due date updated successfully",
  });
  setIsEditingDueDate(false);
  
  // Force a reload to bypass any caching issues
  window.location.reload();
}
```

The 304 Not Modified status indicates that even though the data has changed on the server, the browser is using a cached version of the response. This explains why even though the due date is correctly updated in the database, your UI isn't reflecting the change.

If you prefer not to reload the page, you can try adding the `refetchInterval: 0` option to your query to force React Query to always fetch fresh data:

```jsx
{
  queryKey: ["/api/freshbooks/clients", id, "projects", id],
  queryFn: async () => {
    // Your existing fetch function
  },
  refetchInterval: 0,
  staleTime: 0,
  cacheTime: 0
}
```

This should help ensure that your component displays the updated due date after it's changed.
