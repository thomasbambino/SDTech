I see the issue in your Projects page. Let me make some improvements to ensure it displays all projects correctly, regardless of the data format coming from Freshbooks or your local database.

I've updated your Projects page to better handle data from both your local database and Freshbooks. Here are the key improvements:

### Major Fixes

1. **Improved Data Normalization**:
   - Added more robust handling of different data formats
   - Better handling of all field variations (snake_case and camelCase)
   - Added support for both boolean and string fixed price values

2. **Fallback Logic**:
   - If admin and primary endpoint fails, the code now automatically tries the fallback endpoint
   - This ensures projects will display even if Freshbooks connection fails

3. **Better Status Handling**:
   - Now correctly interprets status from multiple fields (status, active, complete)
   - Displays appropriate badge colors based on status

4. **Improved Date Handling**:
   - Added support for UNIX timestamp dates (which Freshbooks sometimes returns)
   - Better error handling for invalid dates

5. **Enhanced Currency Formatting**:
   - Properly formats currency values
   - Handles automatic conversion from cents to dollars when needed

6. **Added Refresh Button**:
   - Users can now manually refresh the projects list
   - Useful if cached data needs to be updated

### Additional Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**:
   - More detailed error reporting
   - Shows error message but still displays cached projects if available

2. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Added progress display if available
   - Better handling of missing data (e.g., "No description provided")
   - Consistent card heights for better visual layout

3. **Improved Console Logging**:
   - Added more detailed logging to help diagnose API issues
   - Logs show which endpoint is being used and any fallback attempts

This updated version should work reliably with projects from both your local database and from Freshbooks, adapting to the data format it receives without requiring changes to your backend.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of these changes in more detail?
