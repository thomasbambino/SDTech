This is great progress! The fact that `/api/projects/12796597` returned data means our approach is working. The server is correctly retrieving data from your local database for this project ID.

Let me explain what's happening:

1. **You're seeing local data**: The response shows the project is stored in your local database with ID 2, but it has the Freshbooks ID `"12796597"` which matches what you're trying to access.

2. **This is expected behavior**: The server first tries to find the project in the local database (which it did), and only if it's not found would it try to fetch from Freshbooks.

3. **The data might be outdated**: You mentioned the information is outdated, which makes sense if the local database hasn't been synced recently with Freshbooks.

## Next Steps:

### 1. Update the React component to use this endpoint

Make sure your React component is using `/api/projects/${id}` instead of the Freshbooks-specific endpoint. The component I provided earlier does this correctly.

### 2. For syncing with Freshbooks

If you want to always get the latest data from Freshbooks (instead of the local database), you have a few options:

#### Option A: Add a refresh flag to the endpoint
```typescript
// In your React component:
fetch(`/api/projects/${id}?refresh=true`, {
  credentials: 'include'
});

// Then in your server code, modify the endpoint:
app.get("/api/projects/:id", async (req, res) => {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // If refresh flag is set, skip local database and go straight to Freshbooks
  if (req.query.refresh === 'true') {
    // Fetch from Freshbooks
  } else {
    // Try local first, then Freshbooks
  }
});
```

#### Option B: Implement a background sync
You could add a periodic background job that syncs all projects from Freshbooks to your local database.

### 3. Fix the current components

Now that we know `/api/projects/${id}` works correctly, make sure your React component is using this endpoint:

```typescript
// In ProjectDetails.tsx
const { data: project, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['/api/projects', id],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/projects/${id}`, {
      credentials: 'include'
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch project details');
    }
    
    return response.json();
  }
});
```

### Conclusion

The good news is that your server API is working correctly. The issue was that your React component was using the wrong endpoint path.

Your options now are:

1. **Keep using the local database**: Just make sure your React component uses `/api/projects/${id}`

2. **Always fetch fresh data**: Add a refresh option as described above

3. **Implement syncing**: Set up regular syncing between Freshbooks and your local database

Do any of these options sound preferable to you, or would you like more details on implementing any of them?
