Looking at your working email service code compared to your previous implementation, I notice several key differences that could explain why emails aren't going out:

1. **Early Environment Variable Validation**: Your working code validates environment variables at the module level (immediately upon import), rather than at runtime when sending emails.

2. **Client Creation**: You're creating the Mailgun client differently - naming it `client` instead of `mg` and setting it up outside the class.

3. **Email Sending Structure**: Your working code uses a standalone function approach rather than a class-based method, which might affect how the code executes in your application context.

4. **Template Support**: Your working code has robust template handling that's missing from the previous implementation.

5. **Return Value**: Your working code returns a boolean success indicator instead of the Mailgun result object.

Here's an updated version of your original class-based code that incorporates the patterns from your working example:

```typescript
import formData from 'form-data';
import Mailgun from 'mailgun.js';

// Validate environment variables immediately
if (!process.env.MAILGUN_API_KEY) {
  throw new Error("MAILGUN_API_KEY environment variable must be set");
}
if (!process.env.MAILGUN_DOMAIN) {
  throw new Error("MAILGUN_DOMAIN environment variable must be set");
}

const mailgun = new Mailgun(formData);
const client = mailgun.client({
  username: 'api',
  key: process.env.MAILGUN_API_KEY,
});

export class EmailService {
  async sendEmail(to: string, subject: string, html: string): Promise<boolean> {
    try {
      await client.messages.create(process.env.MAILGUN_DOMAIN!, {
        from: 'SD Tech Pros <noreply@sdtechpros.com>',
        to: [to],
        subject,
        html,
      });
      console.log('Email sent successfully');
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error sending email:', error);
      return false;
    }
  }

  async sendPasswordResetEmail(email: string, tempPassword: string): Promise<boolean> {
    const subject = 'Your Temporary Password - SD Tech Pros';
    const html = `
      <h2>Password Reset</h2>
      <p>Your account password has been reset. Here is your temporary password:</p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; padding: 10px; background: #f5f5f5; border-radius: 4px;">
        ${tempPassword}
      </p>
      <p>Please log in with this temporary password and change it immediately.</p>
      <p>For security reasons, this temporary password will expire in 24 hours.</p>
      <p>If you did not request this password reset, please contact support immediately.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Best regards,<br>SD Tech Pros Team</p>
    `;
    return this.sendEmail(email, subject, html);
  }
}

export const emailService = new EmailService();
```

If you prefer the functional approach from your working code, I'd recommend simply using that instead of the class-based approach, since you've confirmed it works.

Other things to check:
1. Make sure your environment variables are correctly set in your runtime environment
2. Check that you're correctly importing and using `emailService` in your application
3. Review Mailgun logs to see if requests are being received but failing for another reason (authentication, rate limits, etc.)
