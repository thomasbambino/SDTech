I can see a few issues with your TypeScript/Node.js email service code using Mailgun. Here are the problems:

1. The `sendEmail` method is marked as `private`, but it's being called by the public `sendPasswordResetEmail` method. This is not necessarily wrong, but it means you can only send emails through the specific methods you create (like `sendPasswordResetEmail`).

2. More importantly, there's an issue with how you're initializing Mailgun. The correct import and initialization should be:

```typescript
import formData from 'form-data';
import Mailgun from 'mailgun.js';

const mailgun = new Mailgun(formData);
```

Note the lowercase `formData` instead of `FormData`. The package name is 'form-data' but you typically import it as lowercase.

3. The non-null assertion operator (`!`) on environment variables doesn't guarantee they exist at runtime. You should add validation to check if these environment variables are defined.

4. You're not exporting the `EmailService` constructor, only the singleton instance `emailService`.

Here's a corrected version:

```typescript
import formData from 'form-data';
import Mailgun from 'mailgun.js';

const mailgun = new Mailgun(formData);
const mg = mailgun.client({
  username: 'api',
  key: process.env.MAILGUN_API_KEY || '',
});

export class EmailService {
  private async sendEmail(to: string, subject: string, html: string) {
    // Validate environment variables
    if (!process.env.MAILGUN_DOMAIN) {
      throw new Error('MAILGUN_DOMAIN environment variable is not set');
    }
    if (!process.env.MAILGUN_API_KEY) {
      throw new Error('MAILGUN_API_KEY environment variable is not set');
    }

    try {
      const result = await mg.messages.create(process.env.MAILGUN_DOMAIN, {
        from: 'SD Tech Pros <noreply@sdtechpros.com>',
        to: [to],
        subject,
        html,
      });
      console.log('Email sent successfully:', result);
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error sending email:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }

  async sendPasswordResetEmail(email: string, tempPassword: string) {
    const subject = 'Your Temporary Password - SD Tech Pros';
    const html = `
      <h2>Password Reset</h2>
      <p>Your account password has been reset. Here is your temporary password:</p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; padding: 10px; background: #f5f5f5; border-radius: 4px;">

    `;
    return this.sendEmail(email, subject, html);
  }
}

export const emailService = new EmailService();
