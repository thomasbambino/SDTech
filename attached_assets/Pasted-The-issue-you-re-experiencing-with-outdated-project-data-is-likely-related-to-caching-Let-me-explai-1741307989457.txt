The issue you're experiencing with outdated project data is likely related to caching. Let me explain the problem and how to fix it:

## The Problem

Your Projects page is still showing old project data despite changes being made days ago. This happens for a few key reasons:

1. **Browser Caching**: The page is using localStorage to cache project data and is showing this cached data instead of fresh data from the server.

2. **Stale Query Data**: React Query (from @tanstack/react-query) is also caching the API responses, and it might not be refreshing as expected.

3. **Insufficient Cache Invalidation**: When changes are made elsewhere, the cache isn't being properly invalidated.

## The Solution

Here's how to fix this so you always see the latest project data:

I've updated the Projects page to fix the issue with outdated project data. Here are the key changes I made:

## 1. Eliminated localStorage Caching

The main problem was that your code was using localStorage to cache project data. This meant that even when you fetched fresh data, the component would still display the old data from the cache.

- Removed the `localProjects` state and localStorage caching
- Added code to clear any existing cache on component mount:
  ```javascript
  // Clear localStorage cache on component mount
  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.removeItem('projects_cache');
    refetch();
  }, [refetch]);
  ```

## 2. Disabled React Query Caching

React Query was also caching API responses, making your data stale:

- Set `staleTime: 0` to always consider data stale and ready for refetching
- Set `cacheTime: 1000` (very short) to clear cache quickly
- Enabled `refetchOnMount` and `refetchOnWindowFocus` to refetch data more aggressively

## 3. Added Cache-Busting Headers

Even with these changes, browser or network caching could still be an issue:

- Added cache-busting headers to all fetch requests:
  ```javascript
  headers: {
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'Pragma': 'no-cache'
  }
  ```

## 4. Improved the Refresh Button

I enhanced the refresh button to be more effective:

- It now clears the localStorage cache completely
- Forces a complete refetch of the data
- Provides visual feedback during the refresh process

## 5. Better Error Handling

I also improved error handling for non-array responses and added more detailed logging to help troubleshoot any API issues.

## How to Use

The page should now automatically show the latest project data whenever you:
1. First load the page
2. Switch back to the page from another tab
3. Click the refresh button

If you still see outdated data after implementing these changes, it likely indicates a more complex issue, possibly on the server side. In that case, we would need to examine how project data is being updated and stored in your backend.
