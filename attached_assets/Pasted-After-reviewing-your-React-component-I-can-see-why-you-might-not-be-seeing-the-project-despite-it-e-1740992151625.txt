After reviewing your React component, I can see why you might not be seeing the project despite it existing in the Freshbooks API. There are several potential issues:

1. **Data Structure Mismatch**: The project data structure you're expecting in your React component doesn't match what Freshbooks is returning. 

   Your component expects projects with this structure:
   ```typescript
   interface Project {
     id: string;
     title: string;
     description: string;
     status: string;
     dueDate?: string;
     budget?: number;
     fixedPrice?: string;
     createdAt: string;
   }
   ```

   But the Freshbooks API returns:
   ```json
   {
     "id": 12796597,
     "title": "Test Project\n",
     "description": null,
     "due_date": "2025-03-31",  // different from dueDate
     "client_id": 1163333,
     "internal": false,
     "budget": 36000,
     "fixed_price": "50.00",    // different from fixedPrice
     "active": true,
     "complete": false,
     "created_at": "2025-03-03T07:58:38", // different from createdAt
     ...
   }
   ```

2. **Missing Field Mapping**: The API response doesn't directly have a "status" field, but your component expects one. You need to map the API fields (`active`, `complete`) to your component's `status` field.

3. **Property Name Discrepancies**: The API uses snake_case (`due_date`, `fixed_price`, `created_at`) but your component expects camelCase (`dueDate`, `fixedPrice`, `createdAt`).

4. **Backend Transformation Issue**: Your backend API endpoint might not be properly transforming the raw Freshbooks data to match what your frontend expects.

To fix this, you need to either:

1. Update your backend API (`/api/freshbooks/clients/${id}/projects`) to transform the Freshbooks data into the format your frontend expects, or

2. Modify your React component to handle the data as it's actually returned from your API.

Looking at your backend code and the response you showed, I suspect the backend isn't properly transforming the fields from the Freshbooks API into the format your frontend component expects. Check if your `formatDate` function is being used on the project data, and whether properties are being correctly mapped from snake_case to camelCase.
