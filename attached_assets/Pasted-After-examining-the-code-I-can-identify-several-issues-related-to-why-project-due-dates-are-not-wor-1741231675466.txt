After examining the code, I can identify several issues related to why project due dates are not working properly. Let me break down the main problems:

1. **Inconsistent API Endpoints**: The code is trying to update due dates using different Freshbooks API endpoints in different places. For example:

   - In the `PATCH` endpoint at `/api/freshbooks/clients/:clientId/projects/:projectId`, it's using the accounting API:
     ```javascript
     `https://api.freshbooks.com/accounting/account/${accountId}/projects/projects/${projectId}`
     ```

   - But in other places, it's using the projects API:
     ```javascript
     `https://api.freshbooks.com/projects/business/${businessId}/project/${req.params.id}`
     ```

2. **Inconsistent Parameter Formatting**: When updating due dates, the formatting isn't consistent:
   - Some places are just passing the due_date directly
   - The structure expected by the Freshbooks API might require a specific date format

3. **Error Handling Issues**: The code attempts to update the due date but doesn't properly handle the response or potential errors from the Freshbooks API.

4. **Multiple Implementations**: There are several redundant implementations of project endpoints, which can lead to confusion about which one is actually being used.

5. **Debugging Information**: While there are debug endpoints for clients and projects, there isn't one specifically for tracking due date updates.

The most likely issue is in the `PATCH` endpoint at `/api/freshbooks/clients/:clientId/projects/:projectId`, where it's trying to update the due date. The error logging shows it's expecting to use the accounting API for a resource that might be accessible only through the projects API.

To fix this, I would recommend:

1. Standardize on using the projects API for all project operations:
   ```javascript
   `https://api.freshbooks.com/projects/business/${businessId}/project/${projectId}`
   ```

2. Ensure the date format is consistent and compatible with Freshbooks' requirements
   
3. Add better error handling and logging specifically for due date updates

4. Create a specific debug endpoint to test due date updates and trace the requests and responses
