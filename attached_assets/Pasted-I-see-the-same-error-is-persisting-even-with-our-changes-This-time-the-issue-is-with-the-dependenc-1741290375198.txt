I see the same error is persisting even with our changes. This time, the issue is with the dependency array in the useEffect hook. Let's fix it by using a safer approach to handle the dependency:

We're still encountering the `Cannot access 'project' before initialization` error. The issue is in how React evaluates the dependency array in your `useEffect` hook.

The solution is to completely avoid referencing `project` in the dependency array. Here's the safe way to rewrite this code:

```jsx
// First, set up your component with these state variables (keep the existing ones)
const { id } = useParams<{ id: string }>();
const [editedTitle, setEditedTitle] = useState('');
const [editedDescription, setEditedDescription] = useState('');
const [budget, setBudget] = useState<number | undefined>(undefined);
const [fixedPrice, setFixedPrice] = useState<number | undefined>(undefined);
// ... other states

// Then fetch your project data with useQuery (keep your existing query)
const {
  data: project,
  isLoading: projectLoading,
  error: projectError
} = useQuery<FreshbooksProject>({ /* ... your existing query config ... */ });

// IMPORTANT: Replace the problematic useEffect with this
useEffect(() => {
  // This will run whenever project changes and is defined
  if (project) {
    setEditedTitle(project.title);
    setEditedDescription(project.description || '');
    setBudget(project.budget ? project.budget / 100 : 0);
    setFixedPrice(typeof project.fixedPrice === 'boolean' ? 0 :
      parseFloat(project.fixedPrice?.toString() || '0'));
    
    // You could also load the due date from project if available
    if (project.due_date || project.dueDate) {
      setLocalDueDate(project.due_date || project.dueDate || null);
    }
  }
}, [project]); // This is safe because we're using the whole project object
```

The key changes:

1. We're now using the entire `project` object in the dependency array. This is safer because it's a direct reference to the query result.

2. We're checking if `project` exists before trying to access its properties. This avoids the "before initialization" error.

3. This effect will run whenever the project data changes, which is exactly what we want - initializing forms when data is loaded and updating them if the data changes.

This approach is more reliable and should work without the initialization error.
