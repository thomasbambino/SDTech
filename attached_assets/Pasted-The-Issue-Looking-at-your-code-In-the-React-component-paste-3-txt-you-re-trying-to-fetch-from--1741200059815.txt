The Issue
Looking at your code:

In the React component (paste-3.txt), you're trying to fetch from:
Copy/api/freshbooks/clients/${id}/projects/${id}

But in your server code (paste.txt), the primary project endpoint is:
Copy/api/projects/:id


Additionally, I noticed a duplicate endpoint implementation in your server code, which could cause conflicts and unexpectedness in routing.
The Solution
I've created a completely revised ProjectDetails component that:

Uses the correct API endpoint: It calls /api/projects/${id} which matches your server code
Includes proper error handling: Detailed error states with useful messages
Adds better debugging: Console logs that help diagnose any issues
Simplifies the code: Removes unnecessary fallback logic

Key Changes:

Fixed the API call:
typescriptCopyfetch(`/api/projects/${id}`, {
  credentials: 'include',
});

Added improved error display:

Shows detailed error information
Provides troubleshooting suggestions
Includes refresh and back buttons


Enhanced note functionality:

Fixed note loading
Added delete functionality
Improved loading states



Implementation Steps

Replace your entire ProjectDetails component with the code I've provided in the "Fixed ProjectDetails Component with Correct API Call" artifact.
Verify your server implementation:

Make sure the getFreshbooksToken helper function is being used in the /api/projects/:id endpoint
Confirm your FRESHBOOKS_ADMIN_TOKEN environment variable is set properly



Debugging
If you continue to experience issues:

Inspect the network requests:

Open your browser's developer tools (F12)
Go to the Network tab
Find the request to /api/projects/[your-id]
Check the response status and body


Verify the admin token:

Check your environment variables
Make sure the token hasn't expired


Test the API directly:

Try accessing /api/projects/[your-id] directly in your browser or with a tool like Postman



The API Endpoint Debugging Guide I've provided contains additional steps and tools to help troubleshoot any persistent issues.
