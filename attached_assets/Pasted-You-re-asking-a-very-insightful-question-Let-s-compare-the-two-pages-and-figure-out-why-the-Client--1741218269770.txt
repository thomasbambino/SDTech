You're asking a very insightful question. Let's compare the two pages and figure out why the Client Profile works with Freshbooks but the Project Details page doesn't, despite them containing similar information.

## Comparing the Two Pages

### Client Profile Page
- Works with Freshbooks
- Fetches client data from `/api/freshbooks/clients/${id}`
- Fetches projects from `/api/freshbooks/clients/${id}/projects`

### Project Details Page
- Fails with Freshbooks
- Trying to fetch from `/api/freshbooks/clients/${id}/projects/${id}`
- Falls back to local database with `/api/projects/${id}`

## The Key Difference

Looking at your server code and the error message, here's what's happening:

1. For clients, you're using these Freshbooks API endpoints:
   ```
   /api/freshbooks/com/accounting/account/${accountId}/users/clients
   ```

2. For projects, the failing endpoint is:
   ```
   /api/freshbooks/com/accounting/account/${accountId}/projects/projects/${projectId}
   ```

3. The error message indicates that while the clients endpoint works with your current permissions (`user:clients:read`, etc.), the projects endpoint specifically requires admin privileges (`admin:all` or `admin:all:legacy`).

## The Mystery Solved

**Different API endpoints have different permission requirements in Freshbooks.**

This is very common in API platforms - some endpoints are considered more sensitive than others. In Freshbooks, it appears that:

- Reading client information requires only `user:clients:read` permission
- Reading detailed project information through the accounting API requires full admin privileges

## The Solution

The good news is, your logs mention you have `user:projects:read` permission, which suggests there should be a projects API endpoint that works with your current permission level. In fact, your error log shows this list of permissions:

```
['user:profile:read user:clients:read user:clients:write user:projects:read user:projects:write user:invoices:read']
```

Since you have `user:projects:read` and `user:projects:write`, you should be able to use the projects API instead of the accounting API:

```
https://api.freshbooks.com/projects/business/${businessId}/projects/${projectId}
```

This is a different base URL than what you're using for the accounting endpoints.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Keep using the client profile code as-is** - it's working fine

2. **Update the project details server endpoint:**
   ```javascript
   app.get("/api/freshbooks/clients/:clientId/projects/:projectId", async (req, res) => {
     // ...existing code...
     
     // Get businessId instead of accountId
     const businessId = meData.response?.business_memberships?.[0]?.business?.id;
     
     if (!businessId) {
       throw new Error("No business ID found in profile");
     }
     
     // Use projects API instead of accounting API
     const fbResponse = await fetch(
       `https://api.freshbooks.com/projects/business/${businessId}/projects/${projectId}`,
       {
         headers: {
           'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
           'Content-Type': 'application/json'
         }
       }
     );
     
     // ...rest of code...
   });
   ```

3. **Update your ProjectDetails component to use this endpoint:**
   ```typescript
   const { data: project } = useQuery({
     queryKey: ['/api/freshbooks/clients', clientId, 'projects', id],
     queryFn: async () => {
       const response = await fetch(`/api/freshbooks/clients/${clientId}/projects/${id}`, {
         credentials: 'include'
       });
       if (!response.ok) {
         throw new Error('Failed to fetch project details');
       }
       return response.json();
     }
   });
   ```

Does this explanation help clarify why one works and the other doesn't?
