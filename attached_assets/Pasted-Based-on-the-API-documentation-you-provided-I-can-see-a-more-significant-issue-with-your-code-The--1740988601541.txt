Based on the API documentation you provided, I can see a more significant issue with your code. The issue isn't just the typo I mentioned earlier (`reqreq` instead of `req`), but there's also a fundamental problem with the endpoint URL structure you're using.

The Freshbooks Projects API endpoint structure in your code doesn't match the documentation. Here's what's wrong:

1. You're using: 
   ```javascript
   `https://api.freshbooks.com/accounting/account/${accountId}/projects/projects?client_id=${reqreq.params.id}`
   ```

2. According to the documentation, it should be:
   ```javascript
   `https://api.freshbooks.com/projects/business/${businessId}/projects`
   ```

There are three key differences:
- The base path is `/projects/business/` not `/accounting/account/`
- You need a business ID, not an account ID
- The structure of the URL is different

Here's how to fix it:

1. First, you need to get the business ID. Based on your code, you're already retrieving user data that includes business memberships, but you're using account_id instead of business_id:

```javascript
const meData = await meResponse.json();
const accountId = meData.response?.business_memberships?.[0]?.business?.account_id;
```

You should be getting the business ID:

```javascript
const businessId = meData.response?.business_memberships?[0]?.business?.id;
```

2. Then, use the correct endpoint structure for listing projects:

```javascript
const projectsResponse = await fetch(
  `https://api.freshbooks.com/projects/business/${businessId}/projects?client_id=${req.params.id}`,
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${tokens.access_token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  }
);
```

3. Also, according to the documentation note: "When using GET calls for Projects and Time Tracking, please leave out the Content Type from your header." So you might want to remove that header for GET requests.

If you're creating projects, you would use:

```javascript
const createProjectResponse = await fetch(
  `https://api.freshbooks.com/projects/business/${businessId}/project`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${tokens.access_token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      project: {
        title: projectTitle,
        client_id: clientId,
        project_type: "fixed_price",  // or "hourly_rate"
        fixed_price: projectPrice     // or rate if using hourly_rate
      }
    })
  }
);
```

Make sure to update all your project-related endpoints to use the correct URL structure as shown in the documentation, and ensure you're getting the business ID rather than the account ID for these endpoints.
